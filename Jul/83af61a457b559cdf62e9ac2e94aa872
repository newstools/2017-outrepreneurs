Google Chief Executive Officer, Sundar Pichai, has emphasized the need for Africa to transit into the digital economy to enhance the growth of its small businesses. Sundar, who is currently on a visit to Nigeria, made the statement at an event organized by Google in Lagos, on Thursday 27th July. He also revealed the company’s plan to train 10 million more people through its Digital Skills Africa project. According to him, 1 million people have been trained since 2016, when the program began to address the digital skill gap in the continent. “For me, it is about how do you make the transition into the digital economy?  One of the things we have been doing around the world including Africa is what we call a digital skill training. In Africa now, we have trained 1 million people and we are coming to train 10 million people,” Sundar said. “By that, we are talking about people who are doing small things, small businesses and, maybe, side hustle in a place like Nigeria. How do we leverage digital platforms to reach more people and grow the businesses?” Sundar also visited Computer Village, the popular computer and allied products market in Lagos, where he snapped a photograph which he posted on his twitter handle. The Google CEO added that he was fascinated by the spirit of enthusiasm in Nigeria: “In coming to Nigeria, I was struck by the energy, the enthusiasm and happiness of the people here. I think people are the most important resources that the country has.”  comments
