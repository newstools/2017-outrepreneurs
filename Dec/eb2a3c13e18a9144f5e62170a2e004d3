Paystack is a payments processing company that lets businesses accept payments via debit card or money transfer on their websites or mobile apps. Paystack was the very first Nigerian company to get into YC – which is no small feat! Shola is a software engineer by training; his foray into software engineering started when his uncle gifted him a computer. We discuss his journey as a developer, from being a part of the vibrant tech ecosystem at Babcock University to building a tracking tool for Heineken and getting his first 10 Paystack customers. As of 2015, no other payment processor or gateway was facilitating recurring payments for merchants. This was Paystack’s x-factor and entry point.
