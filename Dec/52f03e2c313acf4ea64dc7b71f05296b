African startups can participate in an accelerator programme that will begin in February 2018 at the Norway-based Katapult Accelerator. Selected startups will receive up to $150,000 USD investment in return for 8% equity. The 3-month accelerator programme, which will hold in Oslo, Norway, is designed for startups deploying artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT) and virtual reality (VR) technologies to solve environmental and societal problems. Some of the benefits for the selected startups include access to network of leading thematic mentors, investments and further capital to help them scale in their businesses. “There is no shortage of talent out there but in many cases, they lack the proper support needed to bring their dreams to life,” reads a statement on the website of Katapult Accelerator. “We’re creating the ultimate platform to turn the passion of talented founders like you into something great. We know founders can learn more effectively with proper mentorship and deep access to industry experts, and they need the right software tools to grow. We also know this talent lies in every corner of the globe, so we’re agnostic about where you call home,” the statement continues.
