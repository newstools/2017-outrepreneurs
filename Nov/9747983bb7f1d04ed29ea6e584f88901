Young Nigerians aged 18-31 who are enterprising, talented, and committed to the growth and development of the country and Africa are mostly nominated for the awards. The awards was launched in 2004 as part of activities of a social enterprise, Future Project, set up with the aim of promoting strong, practical commitment to human and capital development, especially in Africa. The Future Project was conceived by the duo of Adebola Williams and Chude Jideonwo, co-founders of Red Media, a Public Relations (PR) and Communication Agency in Nigeria. “Emerging from an economic recession, Nigeria is currently at a defining moment. Through the actions and motivations of these nominees, we believe that our country is positioned for a better future – a Nigeria that will not be limited by tribe or religion but united by its immense possibilities,” said Bukunyi Olateru-Olagbegi, Chairman, Central Working Committee, The Future Awards Africa.
