HotelOga is a hotel management system that enables hotels in Africa to have their own booking engine, websites and customer relationship management system. Earlier this year, HotelOga merged with Savanna Sunrise, another travel and hospitality marketing company based in Kenya. Prior to starting HotelOga, Marek was the Managing Director of Jovago, one of the Rocket Internet companies in Africa. Marek was born and grew up in Poland, where he founded two startups. He now calls Nigeria home, and he is making a big bet on the future growth of the continent. In this interview, we chat about Marek’s journey into the startup ecosystem in Africa. We discuss how Jovago grew to over 20,000 hotels in Africa, as well as his view about how to start and scale internet businesses on the continent. We also talk about the future of online travel agencies in Africa, in a wider context of how online aggregators shape fragmented markets.
