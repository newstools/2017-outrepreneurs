Village Capital, a venture capital firm based in the USA, is accepting applications from fintech startups among some African countries including Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana, Uganda, Rwanda, and Tanzania for its incubator programme tagged:  “Fintech Africa 2018.” The incubator programme is organized in collaboration with Paypal to further promote the growth of  financial technology (fintech) services such as peer-to-peer mobile payments that have made financial services much more accessible, and brought millions of unbanked and underbanked Africans closer to the formal economy. According to Village Capital, fintech startups that will be admitted into the programme must be addressing problems in areas like insurance, pensions and savings, cooperative finance, financial literacy, and data analytics. Startups applying fintech to other sectors like agriculture, energy, education, and health will be considered also. Fintech Africa 2018 will commence in March 2018. Two startups among the participants in the incubator programme will receive US$100,000 investment each from Village Capital.
