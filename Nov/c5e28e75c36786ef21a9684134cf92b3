This episode is a lesson on how to get traction for your startup by focusing on ‘One Metric that Matters’! It is very tempting to do a lot of things at the same time as an entrepreneur. Deepankar had that challenge. But he had a good advisor who told him to focus on one thing only. They focused on a single metric – the number of businesses added to Vconnect platform within a specific geography. That was a major contributor to their early success. I have seen this work a lot. When I get the team at Starta to focus our energies and resources on dialing up a particular growth metric, we see traction. But it’s easy for us to fall into the trap of pursuing many rats….. Deepankar fell into that trap too. Vconnect tried to pivot into becoming an e-commerce platform. That didn’t go well. But it was a good experiment that provided significant learning for the startup. One of my biggest takeaways from this episode is this: e-commerce business is harder and more complex than people think it is from the outside. It is one of the most difficult businesses to scale. And success is dependent on a lot of factors that are beyond the control of one company. E-commerce companies are built on a lot of existing and continuously innovating infrastructure such as payment, logistics, stock management, consumer behaviour, merchant education and trust. If you run a business that sells, or has a potential to sell via e-commerce platform, this episode is for you. Stay humble, stay focused, and stay grounded.
