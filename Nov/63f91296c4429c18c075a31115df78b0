One of their key products is Paylater, a lending mobile app that enables people to get access to short term loans in Nigeria as quickly as possible. Ngozi has an interesting background…. he has a First Class degree in Physics from Imperial College, London, an MSc in Computation from Oxford University, and an MBA from The Wharton School. Before he started his business. He had a career as a finance man. He used to be an investment banker with JPMorgan, a risk consultant with Arthur Andersen UK, and worked as a financial analyst with Deloitte. But now, Ngozi wears many hats as an entrepreneur. He is involved in several other businesses such as Cafe Neo, a coffee chain with outlets in Lagos and Kigali. In this episode, we spend a bit of our time talking about the opportunities and challenges in running multiple businesses at the same time, and the paradox of focus for African entrepreneurs. When I met Ngozi in 2016, we had coffee at one of his coffee shops. Since then we’ve done some projects together, and also had several conversations about the growth and impact of tech-enabled businesses in Africa. This episode is an attempt to record one of those conversations (watch out for Ngozi’s laughter in 29 mins) In this episode you’ll learn:  For more details about this podcast, go to: http://www.thestarta.com/articles/podcast/ngozi-dozie-onefi/ All rights reserved.
