Facebook has announced plan to spur innovation and skills development in the Nigerian entrepreneurial ecosystem. An innovation hub, NG Hub, will be established in Lagos in 2018 by the tech giant. The programme will involve the training of 50,000 students, SMEs and entrepreneurs in digital skills across the country, Facebook disclosed at a news conference in Lagos on Wednesday. Emeka Afigbo, Facebook’s Head of Platform Partnerships, Middle East & Africa said:  “Nigeria is producing a new generation of exciting start-ups that have incredible potential. We understand the important role Facebook plays here in Nigeria with developers and start-ups, and we are investing in helping these communities build for the next billion. One of our key passions at Facebook is nurturing and helping to develop the tech and start-up community, and I’m excited to announce our partnership with the Nigerian tech hub ecosystem, especially the NG_HUB space, here in Lagos. Through NG Hub, a culture of collaboration and exchange of ideas will be further strengthened in the Nigerian tech community, according to Facebook. The activities of the innovation hub will be driven in partnership with CcHUB. The company will also partner with other tech hubs outside Lagos like the Ventures Platform in Abuja, CoLab in Kaduna, nHub in Jos and Roar Nigeria in Enugu for small businesses, entrepreneurs, creatives and youth outside Lagos.
