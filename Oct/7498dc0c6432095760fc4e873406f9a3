Abuja based startup, Hello Tractor, is an agricultural technology company focused on moving smallholder farm families out of poverty by increasing their access to timely tractor services (and eventually other farm inputs). Founded by Jehiel Oliver, Van Jones and Martha Haile, Hello Tractor’s technology platform makes it easy and profitable for tractor owners to monetize their services by connecting with smallholder farmers in need of tractor services. With a simple text message, farmers can request for tractors and get connected to the nearest smart tractor operator and within a short time, the tractor arrives and performs the operation forty times more efficiently at one-third the cost of manual labor. Hello Tractor also sells a low-cost tractor monitoring device to tractor owners. The device enables access to the platform’s software and set of apps, designed to ensure smart tractor owners have full visibility of tractor location, tractor activity, maintenance needs, and operator activities. Speaking with Outrepreneurs recently, Martha Haile affirmed that this “uber for agriculture model” for tractors will not be limited to tractors; other farming equipment are also being worked on for lease. Providing this will deliver better yield for rural farmers to further strengthen Nigeria’s economy using innovative technology. “Innovative technology has the potential to provide a ‘leapfrog opportunity’ for Nigeria and the rest of Africa to push forward a progressive agenda to increase productivity, decrease barriers to entry, and support food security for the world,” Haile said. Hello Tractors has participated and received funding from Feed the Future, USAID, Points of Light, University of Chicago Booth School, Echoing Green, the Africa Diaspora Marketplace, and the Mulago Foundation.
