Techstars, a worldwide network that helps entrepreneurs succeed, announced yesterday the launch of Techstars Impact Accelerator. The aim of the launch is to support for-profit, mission-driven founders building technologies to solve the world’s most pressing social and environmental problems. According to a Techstars blog post, the programme will root for companies with focus on developing transformative technologies and innovative business models to solve our most pressing challenges across financial services, healthcare, education, agriculture, energy and more. Techstars Impact Accelerator’s Managing Director, Zoe Schlag, explained the reason why Techstars is investing in mission driven entrepreneurs. “Since Techstars launched 10 years ago, we have had a deeply held belief that some of our biggest global challenges also represent some of our biggest opportunities, so investing in world-class, mission-driven founders is deeply embedded in our DNA. “Over the last several years, we have made several investments in impact companies, including category leaders such as Zipline, which builds drones to deliver crucial medical supplies in Africa; Aunt Bertha, the #1 ranked social service search and referrals platform;  and Connxus, a supplier management solution that allows buyers to achieve their goals of responsible and sustainable sourcing. “We launch the Techstars Impact Accelerator to help world-class, mission-driven entrepreneurs who believe, like us, that solving some of our most pressing social and environmental problems can sit hand-in-hand with building a successful company.” The Techstars Impact Accelerator, based in Austin, Texas, will start accepting applications in December, 2017 and commence in June 2018. The accelerator has famous backers, including Morgan Stanley Investment Management’s AIP Private Markets Team, the Impact America Fund, and Cotter Cunningham , Chief Executive Officer of RetailMeNot.
