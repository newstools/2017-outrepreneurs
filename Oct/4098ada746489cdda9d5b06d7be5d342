The bus ticketing platform, which competed with ten other startups will represent the country at the Seedstars Summit in Switzerland to compete for up to USD 1 million in equity investment and other prizes. Seedstars World has been conducting pitches across different African countries to select startups that will be part of its global competition for seed stage startups in emerging markets and fast-growing startup scenes. At the Zimbabwe round, MyRunner startup was selected as the most promising startup for its solution that allows users to book for buses and track their location through its platform. The second and third positions were clinched by Munch, an online food ordering company, and Equities Nest, a venture capital firm focusing on African stock markets, respectively. In addition, the civic tech prize went to Tipster for promoting citizen journalism, while the best learner prize was awarded to Commonground, a peer-networking app that showed the most progress during the two day boot-camp held at Impact Hub.
